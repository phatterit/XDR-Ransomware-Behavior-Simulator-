XDR-Tester

Enterprise-grade XDR / EDR audit & reporting tool
Safe adversary emulation • MITRE ATT&CK oriented • HTML reporting

📌 Overview

XDR-Tester is a production-safe security audit tool designed to evaluate the effectiveness of XDR / EDR solutions on Windows endpoints.

The project focuses on controlled adversary emulation, generating real behavioral telemetry without exploiting vulnerabilities or causing system damage.
Its primary goal is to answer a simple but critical question:

Does our endpoint protection actually detect and block real attack behaviors?

🎯 Design Goals

Safe for production environments

Behavior-based testing (not signatures)

No data destruction, no credential dumping

Clear distinction between blocked vs allowed actions

Actionable reporting for Blue / Purple / Security Engineering teams

🧠 Core Concepts

Simulates real attack techniques, not malware

Uses WinAPI through hardened C# bindings

Differentiates between:

ALERT → attack succeeded (security risk)

BLOCK / FAIL → protection worked as expected

Generates HTML audit reports for non-technical stakeholders

🧩 Implemented Techniques (MITRE ATT&CK Oriented)
Technique	Description
Ransomware behavior	AES-256 memory encryption + VSS interaction
Credential Access	LSASS OpenProcess probing (no dump)
Persistence	Registry Run key modification
Command & Control	HTTPS beaconing (/favicon.ico)
Process Injection (safe)	Handle enumeration + global keyboard hook
Keylogging (audit-safe)	Global hook with CallNextHookEx (no capture)

All techniques are implemented in a non-destructive, reversible, and auditable manner.

🛡️ Security & Stability

Garbage Collector safe (global delegate references)

Correct WinAPI contracts (no undefined behavior)

No UI freezing (WPF dispatcher control)

Context-aware execution (Admin vs User mode)

Full cleanup after every test

The tool is explicitly designed not to bypass security, but to test if security reacts properly.

📊 Reporting

XDR-Tester includes a built-in HTML reporting engine:

Color-coded timeline of events

Aggregated statistics:

Scenarios executed

Attacks blocked

Attacks allowed (risk)

Host, user, and execution context

Suitable for:

SOC reviews

audits

academic projects

management summaries

🖥️ GUI

Built with PowerShell + WPF

Clear status indicators

Per-test progress bars

Manual execution of scenarios

One-click report generation

🚀 Use Cases

XDR / EDR effectiveness audits

SOC visibility validation

Purple Team gap analysis

Security engineering labs

Academic projects and theses

Internal security posture assessments

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is not malware and is not intended for unauthorized use.

It does not exploit vulnerabilities, does not dump credentials, and does not exfiltrate data.

Run only:

on systems you own

or where you have explicit authorization

👤 Author & Motivation

This project was created as a security engineering / cyber defense project, with focus on:

system stability

correctness of low-level API usage

meaningful security telemetry

audit-friendly output

It reflects real-world Blue / Purple / Security Engineering workflows, rather than offensive exploitation.

🔚 Project Status

v5.2 – Feature Complete

Further development would focus on:

analytics

MITRE coverage scoring

CI / automated runs

Not on adding more aggressive attack primitives.
